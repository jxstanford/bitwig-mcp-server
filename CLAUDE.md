# Bitwig MCP Server Project Status

## Project Overview

This project is creating a server that will allow Claude to control Bitwig Studio through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The server will translate between MCP requests from Claude and OSC commands to Bitwig.

## Progress

### Completed

- Basic project structure created based on modern Python best practices
- OSC communication layer implemented:
  - `BitwigOSCClient`: Sends OSC messages to Bitwig
  - `BitwigOSCServer`: Receives OSC messages from Bitwig
  - `BitwigOSCController`: Coordinates bidirectional communication
- Created user stories document in `docs/user_stories.md`

### In Progress

- Designing the MCP Server implementation that will translate between MCP and OSC
- Implementing MCP-specific components to handle Claude's connections

## Next Steps

Based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation and SDK, we need to:

1. Set up the MCP server using the Python SDK to handle communication with Claude
2. Define resources and tools that expose Bitwig functionality to Claude
3. Implement the translation layer between MCP requests and OSC commands
4. Create prompts for common music production workflows
5. Test the integration with Claude Desktop

## Current Task

Based on the MCP documentation and SDK, we should:

1. Implement an MCP server using the Python SDK (`mcp` package)
2. Create a toolkit of Bitwig-specific tools that Claude can use
3. Expose Bitwig's state as MCP resources
4. Define prompts for common music production workflows
5. Define the architecture for translating between MCP and OSC
6. Implement the bidirectional communication flow
7. Create a simplified API that Claude can easily understand

Let's start by designing the architecture for the MCP server layer that builds on our existing OSC integration work.

## MCP Implementation Approach

### MCP Components

- **Tools**: Active operations Claude can perform on Bitwig (transport controls, parameter changes)
- **Resources**: Queryable state and information from Bitwig (track list, device parameters)
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates for common workflows (track creation, mixing setup)

### Implementation Strategy

We will use the FastMCP approach from the Python SDK for simplified server creation, with stdio transport for Claude Desktop integration. Our implementation will focus on translating between MCP tools/resources and OSC commands.

## User Stories

See the User Stories document for detailed user stories guiding our implementation.

## Implementation Plans

- Revised Implementation Plan outlines our overall approach
- MCP Integration Details describes how we'll use the MCP protocol
- First Milestone Implementation Plan provides concrete steps for our first milestone

## Questions to Resolve

- How should we structure the MCP tools to make them intuitive for Claude?
- What resources should we expose from Bitwig to Claude?
- How should we organize the translation between MCP requests and OSC commands?
- How to handle state tracking across multiple Claude sessions?
- What prompts would be most useful for common music production workflows?
