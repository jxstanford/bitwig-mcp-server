# Bitwig MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Current Status

We have implemented the core components of the Bitwig MCP Server, providing a bridge between Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Bitwig Studio's OSC API.

### Completed Components

✅ **OSC Communication Layer**

- BitwigOSCClient for sending messages to Bitwig
- BitwigOSCServer for receiving messages from Bitwig
- BitwigOSCController for coordinating bidirectional communication

✅ **MCP Integration - Core**

- FastMCP server implementation
- Tool registration for Bitwig control
- Resource exposure for Bitwig state

✅ **Basic Features**

- Transport controls (play, stop, tempo)
- Track controls (volume, pan, mute)
- Device parameter control
- Project and track information

✅ **Testing**

- Unit tests for server components
- Integration tests with Bitwig Studio

✅ **Documentation**

- README with setup and usage instructions
- Architecture documentation
- Implementation plan

## Next Steps

The following components and features are planned for future implementations:

## Implementation Details

### MCP Features

The server implements the following MCP features:

1. **Tools**

   - Control tools for Bitwig transport
   - Mixer and device parameter controls
   - Information retrieval tools

2. **Resources**

   - Project information
   - Track and device state
   - Parameter values

3. **Prompts**
   - Setup guides for common tasks
   - Mixing and production templates

### Bitwig Studio Integration

The server integrates with Bitwig Studio through:

1. **OSC Protocol**

   - Standard OSC messages
   - Bidirectional communication
   - Event monitoring

2. **Bitwig Extensions**
   - Compatible with standard OSC controller
   - No additional extensions required

## Deployment Plans

### Installation Methods

1. **Direct Installation**

   - Setup via `uv sync`
   - Manual configuration

2. **Claude Desktop Integration**
   - MCP server registration
   - Automated installation

### Distribution Channels

1. **GitHub Repository**

   - Source code distribution
   - Installation instructions

2. **Python Package**
   - PyPI distribution
   - Version management

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. **Core Functionality**

   - All basic Bitwig functions can be controlled via MCP
   - Stable and reliable communication

2. **User Experience**

   - Easy setup and configuration
   - Intuitive interaction with Claude
